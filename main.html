		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I am a fresh software engineer passionate about web development. I've recently completed my studies, where I gained a solid foundation in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. These technologies have empowered me to create responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly websites.

During my academic journey, I have worked on several projects that allowed me to apply my skills and understand the intricacies of front-end development. I'm enthusiastic about building interactive web applications and continually learning new technologies to enhance my expertise.

Although I'm at the beginning of my professional career, my enthusiasm for coding and dedication to mastering my craft drive me to deliver high-quality work. I'm eager to contribute to a dynamic team, tackle challenging projects, and grow as a software engineer.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my work and reach out if you'd like to connect or learn more about what I do.</p>
